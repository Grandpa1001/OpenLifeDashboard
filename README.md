# OpenLifeDashboard

A self-hosted, no-code personal life dashboard: build your own registers, dictionaries and screens with widgets, and view them live on your phone, laptop and a large screen.

> **Status: early development.** The repository currently contains only the monorepo skeleton. Nothing here is ready to install or use yet.

## Development

Requirements: [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) or pnpm. The exact pnpm version (`packageManager`) and Node.js runtime (`devEngines.runtime`) are pinned in `package.json`; pnpm downloads that Node.js version for scripts automatically.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
```

Workspace layout:

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `apps/server` | HTTP API, SPA hosting, live stream, scheduler |
| `apps/web` | Browser single-page application |
| `packages/core` | Domain rules and use cases, free of frameworks and runtimes |
| `packages/contracts` | Transport schemas, DTOs and error codes |
| `packages/sqlite` | SQLite connection, migrations and repository adapters |
| `packages/widgets` | Widget definitions (`/definitions`) and views (`/views`) |
| `packages/ui` | Presentational components and design tokens |
| `tooling/typescript` | Shared strict TypeScript configuration |
